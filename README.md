Education considered as charitable and philanthropic activity has metamorphosis as an Industry.

Government has taken several initiatives including investment by Foreign Education Institutions (FEI). 

The Public Private Partnership (“PPP”) model has also been introduced in this sector to facilitate greater Foreign Direct Investments (“FDI”). 

Collaboration between well-established foreign universities facilitate greater academic exchange among students. 

The progressive development has attracted the eye of private equity players and venture capital funds as well, who have also shown interest in this unique and emerging business opportunity, 

Interest is increased much as it balances investor returns with social responsibilities.


4. Foreign Investment in the Education Sector

While these factors impact investments in the regulated aspect of education sector to some extent, this, however, does not deter investments in education service provider companies, Ed-tech companies etc, which are currently not regulated. Such entities and businesses are not required to be of a not-for- profit character and are also not required to comply with education sector specific laws.

Foreign investments can primarily be made into companies providing educational and construction services to schools run by Trusts, Societies or Section 8 Companies. Consequently, funds and other investors have invested in education services companies which provide services to such Trusts, Societies or Section 8 Companies and in turn receive compensation for it. A wide array of legitimate services, including management services, teacher training, curriculum designing, etc., can be provided to the entity running the school.
