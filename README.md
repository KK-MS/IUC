Education considered as charitable and philanthropic activity has metamorphosis as an Industry.

Government has taken several initiatives including investment by Foreign Education Institutions (FEI). 

The Public Private Partnership (“PPP”) model has also been introduced in this sector to facilitate greater Foreign Direct Investments (“FDI”). 

Collaboration between well-established foreign universities facilitate greater academic exchange among students.

Interest is increased much as it balances investor returns with social responsibilities.


4. Foreign Investment in the Education Sector

While these factors impact investments in the regulated aspect of education sector to some extent, this, however, does not deter investments in education service provider companies, Ed-tech companies etc, which are currently not regulated.

B. Tutoring & Test Preparation Services.

The ability to deliver consistent quality of teaching and the ability to cater to the varying needs of each student are key challenges to scalability of the business. Scalability may, however, be achieved by the use of technology to deliver content, for assessment and benchmarking and to enable students undertake self-pace learning. Apart from the challenge of scalability, the industry also faces the problem of being highly fragmented. Scalability and profitability will, thus, require a significant commitment from the investors who understand that to build such a business, significant investments from time to time, and a long investment horizon would be required.
